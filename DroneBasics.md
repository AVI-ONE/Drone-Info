# 1. Drone Basics

Before drone operation, it is essential to understand some basics of manipulation, assembly, setup software, and calibration. Here, we cover these elements using the DJI Phantom 4 Pro quadcopter as an example. This video lecture walks users through every step, from unboxing to software setup and safety requirements. Flight planning is covered in a later section.

**Before getting started:** 

*	Read the [Phantom 4 manual](/Documents/Phantom_4_User_Manual_v1.6.pdf) 
*	Review the drone, its basic flight manipulation, rules and regulations for drone flights.
*	Read through the [operations manual and safety guidelines](Documents/CSGIS_Preflight_Planning_and_Safety.pdf) 
*	Practice flying the drone, icluding the controls, manual drone operations, takeoff and landing, changing altitude, and adjusting camera and video settings

### Registering your Drone

Drone registration with the FAA is mandatory in the United States for drones weighing 0.55 pounds (250 grams) or more. Please visit the [FAA drone registration page](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/register_drone) for details.

**IMPORTANT!** The drone industry is growing and changing fast, and regulations are often changed and updated. For example, since September 2023, all drones requiring registration must operate in accordance with the new [remote ID rule](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/remote_id). **For this reason, we strongly recommend that you check the rules regularly with the FAA. Do not rely solely on this guide to esure compliance.**

Again, please visit the [FAA drone registration page](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/register_drone) for details.
 
“Failure to register with the FAA could result in one or a combination of the following: a civil penalty of up to $27,500; a criminal fine of up to $250,000; imprisonment for up to three years.” - FAA
